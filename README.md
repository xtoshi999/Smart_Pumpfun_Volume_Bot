# üöÄ Xtoshi Pumpfun Volume Bot

Welcome to the Pumpfun VolumeX Bot!
This bot helps increase the volume of SPL tokens on Pumpfun by distributing SOL across multiple wallets and performing buy and sell transactions using those wallets continuously on the platform.


## ‚ú® Features

- **Telegram control panel**: Start/stop, configure SOL per swap, slippage, target token, sleep time, and trigger maintenance actions.
- **Wallet orchestration**: Create and load sub-wallets from `wallets.json` with restrictive permissions where possible.
- **LUT lifecycle**: Create, load, and extend a lookup table (`lut.json`) to fit large instruction sets into v0 transactions.
- **Jito bundle support**: Submit critical transactions via Jito for potential MEV protection and inclusion speed (with optional tip).
- **Distribution and collection**:
  - Distribute SOL from the main wallet to sub-wallets.
  - Collect SOL from sub-wallets back to the main wallet.
- **Swap engine**: Randomized buy-then-sell cycles per wallet chunk with compute budget tuning and basic guardrails.
- **Sell-all**: Attempt to liquidate all target tokens across sub-wallets.
- **Safety checks**: Slippage bounds, balance checks, simulated sends in select flows, and file permission hints.


## üì¶ Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Yarn or npm
- A Solana RPC endpoint (e.g., Helius, QuickNode, Triton, or your own)
- A funded Solana wallet private key (base58-encoded 64-byte secret key)
- A Telegram bot token and your Telegram user ID(s)


## ‚ö° Quick Start

1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xtoshi999/Smart_Pumpfun_Volume_Bot.git
cd Smart_Pumpfun_Volume_Bot
# Using yarn
yarn install
# or npm
# npm install
```

2) Create .env

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```env
RPC_URL=YOUR_SOLANA_RPC_URL
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_MAIN_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY_BS58
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS="123456789,987654321"
# Optional overrides
# JITO_TIP_AMOUNT_LAMPORTS=1000000   # default ~0.001 SOL
# NODE_ENV=development_open          # DEV ONLY: opens bot to anyone (unsafe)
```

Security tip (POSIX):
```bash
chmod 600 .env
```

3) Start the Telegram controller

```bash
yarn bot
# or
# npm run bot
```

4) Open Telegram and send /settings to your bot

- Use the inline buttons to configure:
  - SOL/Swap
  - Slippage (0.1%‚Äì50%)
  - Token (Pump.fun CA)
  - Sleep time between cycles
  - Start/Stop bot
  - Sell All Tokens
  - Collect All SOL


## üìú Scripts

- `yarn bot` ‚Äî Run the Telegram controller (`bot.ts`).
- `yarn start` ‚Äî Run the standalone entry (`index.ts`) for direct testing.
- `yarn build` ‚Äî TypeScript build.
- `yarn lint` ‚Äî Lint the project.


## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Reference

Defined in `src/config.ts` and overridable via Telegram UI or env vars:

- `DefaultDistributeAmountLamports` ‚Äî default SOL per sub-wallet (lamports)
- `DefaultJitoTipAmountLamports` ‚Äî default Jito tip (lamports)
- `DefaultSlippage` ‚Äî default slippage fraction (e.g., 0.5 = 50%)
- `DefaultCA` ‚Äî default target token CA placeholder

Required env vars (process will exit if missing):
- `RPC_URL`
- `PRIVATE_KEY`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

Access control:
- `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` ‚Äî comma-separated numeric IDs. If empty and not in `development_open`, access is denied.


## üî¨ How It Works

- `wallets.json`: Stores generated sub-wallet secret keys (base58). Created automatically when needed. Attempts to set read-only perms.
- `lut.json`: Stores the created LUT address. Used to compile v0 messages with address tables for compact transactions.
- Swap loop:
  - Chunks sub-wallets.
  - For each wallet, computes buy and immediate sell with randomized SOL sizes, ATA creation/closure, and guardrails.
  - Uses compute-unit budget settings and optionally Jito tips.


## üß≠ Operational Guidance

- Fund your main wallet sufficiently before starting. The bot estimates costs and will warn for low balance.
- Start small. Test on mainnet with tiny amounts or on a private RPC to validate your setup.
- Keep slippage conservative. High slippage increases loss/MEV risk.
- Prefer private, reliable RPC endpoints.
- Windows note: POSIX file permissions (chmod) may not apply; handle secrets appropriately.


## üß© Troubleshooting

- Bot exits on startup:
  - Ensure `RPC_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` exist in `.env`.
- Unauthorized in Telegram:
  - Add your numeric user ID(s) to `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`.
- Failing token validation:
  - Verify the token is a valid Pump.fun mint and reachable via your RPC.
- LUT errors:
  - Let the bot create one if `lut.json` is missing, then wait ~20‚Äì30s for chain visibility.
- Transaction too large:
  - The bot already chunks instructions, but very large sets may still exceed limits. Reduce wallets per cycle if needed.


## üîê Security Considerations

- Your `.env` contains the main wallet private key. Keep it secret and locked down.
- If the host is compromised, `wallets.json` sub-wallet keys can be stolen.
- Do not enable `development_open` outside local testing.
- Jito bundles and slippage are risk mitigations, not guarantees.
